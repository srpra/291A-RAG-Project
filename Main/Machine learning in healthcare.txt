Machine learning in healthcare: Uses, benefits and pioneers in the field
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are so much more than Chat GPT, image creators, and other ways of filling the internet with even more content. In?a world with data is everything, machine learning can help us analyse and understand this information more effectively. It can help us make breakthrough discoveries and create innovative solutions to improve people’s lives. This is particularly true in the healthcare sector.
In healthcare, machine learning has the potential to transform patient outcomes, enhance the quality of care, streamline healthcare delivery, and, more importantly, make healthcare more accessible and cost-effective.
In recent years, predictive healthcare models have been developed that can accurately identify trends, patterns, and subtle abnormalities that may escape even the most experienced professional, and, as such, applications of machine learning are growing rapidly, from early diagnosis of diseases to predictive analytics and personalised medicine.
How is machine learning used in medicine?
From diagnostics to personalised medicine, machine learning is helping research institutions, companies, and start-up innovate and create transformative solutions across the healthcare sector, including:
Research
In a lab environment, machine learning can help researchers understand how a disease really works and improve hypothesis testing. Through analysis of advanced data sets, algorithms can simulate disease progression which gives researchers insights into how conditions develop and how they respond to treatment. This is especially valuable for diseases like cancer, where being able to predict how a patient is likely to respond to specific drugs can lead to more personalised treatment strategies. Additionally, by using machine learning researchers can develop a hypothesis model, then adjust, refine and replicate the process iteratively based on the evolving data. This process can improve prediction accuracy and improve collaborative efforts between clinicians and data scientists thereby accelerating the development of innovation solutions.
Disease Diagnosis and Prediction
Traditionally, disease diagnosis relied on the experience of the healthcare professional, and to some extent their intuition, along with available tests. But because machine learning can analyse huge amounts of data faster and identify subtle patterns and correlations far more accurately than humans, it is quickly transforming the field of diagnostics. For example, in radiology, machine learning models are trained to examine medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, detecting anomalies like tumours or lesions with remarkable precision. These models are particularly useful for early-stage diagnosis for diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular conditions where early detection is critical for successful treatment outcomes and patient survival.
Beyond diagnostics, by analysing individual patient data including lifestyle factors, genetic predispositions, and previous medical conditions, machine learning is being used in predicting the probability of a patient developing a certain disease, its onset and progression. This allows healthcare providers time to provide personalised care and implement preventative measures and monitoring strategies before a disease becomes symptomatic, which improves patient outcomes.
Personalised medicine and treatment plans
Personalisation is one of the most promising developments in modern medicine. Instead of patients following a one-size-fits-all approach, machine learning can analyse individual patient data to enable healthcare providers to predict which treatment option is likely to be the most effective, minimising the risk of an adverse reaction. This approach is most valuable in fields like oncology, where treatment effectiveness varies enormously between patients.
And because machine learning models are continuously learning from new data, this means personalised treatment plans are dynamic and adaptable. So if a treatment is or isn’t working, the model can suggest adjustments to dosage or medication, meaning it’s continuously being optimised to suit the patient’s evolving condition and ensuring the treatment remains effective, which is especially useful in managing chronic diseases such as hypertension or diabetes.
Additionally, machine learning-driven personalised treatment plans can predict when a patient is most likely to stray from their treatment plan and put into motion interventions such as reminders or follow-up appointments to help patients stick to the plan.

Drug discovery and development
Machine learning is helping researchers with drug development by helping to accurately identify potential new drugs, and predict their safety and effectiveness through:
* Analysing complex biological data such as genetic information, protein structures, and molecular interactions, and predicting how different compounds will interact with various target proteins and enzymes.
* Modelling and predicting how changes to the chemical structure of the drug will affect its performance to ensure that it is safe for patients. This also leads to drugs that are more likely to succeed in the clinical trial phase.
* Analysing past clinical trial data to predict how the new drug might work along with any potential risks. This analysis can also enhance the trial’s design so that it run more efficiently and effectively by identifying suitable patient populations, appropriate dosing strategies, and potential side effects.
When it comes to existing drug data, machine learning analysis can identify repurposing opportunities and predict potential new therapeutic uses for known compounds.
Predictive analytics for patient outcomes
Using machine learning algorithms to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) and other data sources such as genetic information and wearable devices, predictive analytics can model the chances of disease progression to risks of complications and hospital admission/readmission, which enables healthcare providers to proactively address potential health issues before they become critical, ensuring that all interventions are timely, targeted and effective.
The most common applications of predictive analytics in healthcare are:
* Chronic disease management: Models flag when a patient’s condition shows early signs of deterioration based on their historical data and current health indicators, prompting healthcare providers to adjust medications, recommend lifestyle changes, or increase monitoring.
* Treatment response (mainly in oncology): Using data from patients with similar profiles, machine learning algorithms can predict which chemotherapy regimens or targeted therapies are the most likely to be effective. This reduces the trial-and-error approach that can delay effective care and cause unnecessary side effects.
* Post-surgical care: Analysis of pre-existing conditions, surgery complexity, and recovery data models can identify patients likely to have longer recovery times and those at risk of post-surgery complications, such as infections and blood clots. This enables healthcare providers to take preventative action to improve recovery outcomes and reduce readmission risks.
* Medication management: By predicting how patients with specific genetic profiles will respond to certain medication, healthcare providers can prescribe those drugs that will be most effective and least likely to cause side effects.
* Preventive care: For patients at high risk of developing chronic conditions based on individual factors such as family history, lifestyle choices and early warning signs, healthcare providers can implement preventive measures. This leads to better long-term health outcomes and can reduce the problem chronic diseases have on patients and the whole healthcare system.
Improving operational efficiency
Beyond direct patient care, machine learning can help improve operational efficiency and reduce costs across the healthcare system without compromising patient care:
* Optimising resource allocation: Healthcare environments, especially hospitals, often struggle with the unpredictable nature of patient admissions, leading to overstaffing or understaffing, which can either waste resources or compromise patient care. Machine learning models can analyse historical data, such as patient admission rates, seasonal trends, and local population health patterns, to predict future demand for services.
* Administrative tasks: Appointment scheduling, billing, and patient management, are all tasks that are time-consuming and can be prone to errors when done manually. Automating these tasks with machine learning algorithms creates a win-win situation for everyone, by reducing appointment wait time, speeding up payment cycles, and reducing time spent of paperwork.
* Supply chain management: By predicting demand for supplies, optimising inventory levels, and reducing waste, machine learning can help healthcare facilities reduce the costs as well as identifying the best sources for high-quality, cost-effective supplies.
* Patient flow management: Efficient patient flow management is essential for reducing bottlenecks and ensuring that patients receive timely care. Machine learning can predict and manage patient flow by analysing data such as patient demographics, admission patterns, and treatment durations. This can help reduce bottlenecks, whether this is managing bed availability, optimising surgery scheduling, or triaging patients in Accident and Emergency by analysing symptoms and medical history to prioritise those most in need.
* Benefits of machine learning in healthcare
* Earlier diagnosis 
* Machine learning models have been built to accurately identify early signs of disease, leading to earlier intervention, which is crucial for treatment success and better patient outcomes. 
* Drug development 
* Machine learning is helping to optimise various stages of the process, accelerating the drug discovery and development process. 
* Reducing healthcare costs 
* Improving operational efficiency, reducing errors, and enhancing patient outcomes all helps to reduce healthcare costs while maintaining, or even improving quality of patient care. 
* Enhancing data privacy and security 
* The protection of sensitive patient data is a major concern as healthcare becomes digitised. Machine learning models anonymise patient data which ensures compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR, while maintaining the data’s value for research and analysis purposes. Additionally, advanced machine learning algorithms are used to alert healthcare organisations, in real time, of potential breaches or unauthorised access.? 
* Improving Patient Care
* Personalised medicine ensures that each patient receives the treatment that is right for them, improving its effectiveness, reducing side effects, and improving patient experience, but this is only possible with the help of machine learning.?By monitoring?patient health in real-time, machine learning models can support long-term health outcomes by providing continuous, data-driven care to help with chronic disease management and the early detection of potential health issues. 
AI vs machine learning: How do they differ?
* The terms ‘Artificial Intelligence’ (AI) and ‘Machine Learning’ are often used interchangeably, however, in reality, they actually represent different concepts.
* Artificial intelligence: AI uses a wide range of technologies, from simple rule-based systems to advanced neural networks to create intelligent systems that are capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding natural language.
* Machine Learning: This is a subset of AI that provides the tools and techniques needed to create those intelligent systems, and focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
* Understanding the distinction between AI and machine learning is crucial for leveraging their potential. For example, in healthcare, AI might be used to design complex decision-making systems that assist in diagnostics, while machine learning is specifically employed to analyse patient data and predict outcomes, helping to tailor treatment plans to individual patients.
