Abstract
This study aimed to assess how sleep quality affects mental health in adults.
The mean differences (MDs), along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated from the retrieved data
using a continuous model with random- or fixed-effects. Approximately 54 papers, comprising a total of 10,196
adults and conducted between 1998 and 2024, were included in this meta-analysis.
Improving sleep significantly reduced depression (MD, -2.92; 95% CI, -3.61 to -2.24, P-value< 0.001) and anxiety
(MD, -1.14; 95% CI, -1.32 to -0.97, P-value< 0.001) compared to standard care among adults. However, no significant
difference was observed in stress (MD, -1.03; 95% CI, -2.31 to 0.25, P-value= 0.11) between improving sleep and
standard care among adults.
Analysis showed that improving overall sleep quality significantly reduced depression and anxiety, though no
significant difference was observed in stress compared to standard care among adults. However, considering that
the majority of studies had limited sample sizes, the results warrant careful interpretation.

behavioral therapeutic interventions for insomnia, on mental health conditions like depressive disorders and
anxiety.
3. Attempts have been made to investigate the impacts of these trials on mental health-related outcomes by
meta-analyses; however, these studies were unable to draw firm conclusions about the causal link between sleep
disorders and mental health-related outcomes.
4. This meta-analysis study revealed that enhancing the overall quality of sleep significantly lowered depression and
anxiety.

Introduction
Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent globally. Epidemiological studies indicate that nearly one-third of the
entire population experiences insomnia symptoms, such
as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. In addition,
between 4% and 26% report excessive daytime sleepiness, while 2–4% are diagnosed with obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) [1]. A recent study with over 2000 individuals revealed that 32% experienced “general sleep disturbances” [2]. Based on an analysis from the literature,
Chattu et al. revealed that public health professionals
should enhance their awareness of the unfavorable consequences of sleep deprivation [2]. About 17% of adults
experience mental health challenges of varying severity
[3]. Nationally representative data analysis suggests that
such problems are becoming increasingly common [4].
Therefore, both sleep disturbances and mental health
represent major global public health concerns with substantial individual and societal impact [2, 5].
There is a well-established bidirectional link between
sleep disruptions and mental health conditions [6]. It was
once believed that mental health concerns caused sleep
problems [7]; however, it is now recognized that insufficient sleep can also lead to the onset, recurrence [8], and
persistence of mental health illnesses [9]. Understanding
the magnitude of this correlation—and whether enhancing sleep can improve mental health outcomes—has significant clinical and public health implications. People
with insomnia are significantly more likely to experience
clinically severe anxiety and depression (10 and 17 times,
respectively) [10]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of over
twenty longitudinal cohort studies revealed that, compared to people who do not have trouble sleeping, those
who suffer from insomnia are twice as likely to develop
depression [6].
Studies demonstrate that sleep difficulties correlate
with several mental health conditions, particularly highlighting the associations with anxiety, insomnia, and
depression. In addition, inadequate sleep has been linked
to eating disorders [11], posttraumatic stress disorder
[12], and symptoms within the psychosis spectrum, such
as hallucinations and delusions [13]. Moreover, research
demonstrates that patients with mental health disorders
are more likely to experience certain sleep abnormalities,
including sleep apnea [14], circadian rhythm disruptions
[15], restless leg syndrome [16], excessive daytime drowsiness [17], narcolepsy [18], sleepwalking, and nightmares
[19].
Despite significant observational evidence, establishing
causality in the sleep-mental health link remains difficult. Most present research used cross-sectional or longitudinal designs, which can identify connections but are
unable to identify causal direction [20]. Cross-sectional
research is unable to establish temporal sequence, but
longitudinal studies, albeit being more robust, remain
vulnerable to residual confounding and various biases
[21]. Experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [7], improve causal inference by
limiting the effects of confounding variables [8]. To
determine if sleep problems have a causal effect on mental health, researchers must manipulate sleep and record
subsequent mental health changes—a method consistent
with interventionist theories of causality [22]. Numerous
RCTs have assessed the impact of sleep-enhancement
therapies, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia (CBT-I), on mental wellness outcomes such as
depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses have attempted to
consolidate these findings [23].
Nevertheless, existing meta-analyses have numerous
limitations. Initially, certain studies incorporate interventions that failed to enhance sleep, thereby precluding
the evaluation of the association between sleep and mental wellness [24]. Secondly, many research studies focus
mainly on short-term results measured right after the
intervention, which limits understanding of long-term
benefits and creates uncertainty about sustained effects.
Third, the majority of reviews concentrate on CBT-I,
primarily addressing depression, while neglecting other
mental health outcomes and alternative therapies. Ultimately, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the
factors that may influence the efficacy of sleep therapy for
mental health across diverse populations, settings, and
study designs.
Objectives
This evaluation sought to provide a reliable and precise
assessment of how interventions that improve sleep quality affect mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. We selected RCTs that reported improved
sleep quality in the interventional group compared to
controls, and then assessed mental health-related issues
to objectively quantify this benefit. We did not limit cognitive behavioral therapy or mental wellness measures
to depression or anxiety. Rather, we analyzed any sleeprelated approach that led to a significant change in sleep
quality compared to control subjects, and investigated
6. There is a paucity of studies examining the benefits of sleep improvement on mental health outcomes within
existing clinical and community health services. Thus, further clinical service intervention trials are needed to fully
understand the efficacy and implementation of these strategies in routine care.

how that difference influenced subsequent mental health
outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and stress.
To more effectively isolate the impact of sleep enhancement interventions, we excluded therapies that specifically targeted mental health issues, such as CBT designed
to address depressive disorders. Acknowledging the
potential for significant variability among studies, we
employed moderation analyses to examine the impact
of study characteristics and demographic factors on the
outcomes. Our fundamental assertion was that therapies
that significantly enhance sleep would ultimately lead to
corresponding improvements in mental health.
Method
Design
The meta-analyses were conducted using a predefined
epidemiological procedure [9]. Data was collected and
analyzed using several databases, including PubMed, the
Cochrane Library, OVID, Google Scholar, and Embase
[11, 12, 25, 26].
All retrieved studies were combined into a single EndNote file. The initial screening procedure removed duplicate entries. Firstly, we reviewed the titles and abstracts
and excluded ineligible records. Secondly, we continued
screening and evaluated the full-text articles based on
the inclusion criteria, incorporating eligible records into
the review and dismissing ineligible ones, along with
the rationale for their deletion. Two authors performed
an independent review of the documents. These datasets were used to analyze the effects of sleep quality on
adult mental health [27]. To assess the effect size of sleep
quality, we used the following metrics: self-reported
assessments of overall sleep quality, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and measures of sleep
duration and its impact on daily functioning, such as the
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [27].
To measure the effect size of mental health outcomes,
we examined the impact of improved sleep on specific
issues, namely depression, anxiety, and stress, separately
from other mental health outcomes. We measured how
sleep affected each mental health issue reported at the
latest follow-up time of the study. This technique provides a thorough assessment of the influence of improved
sleep quality on mental status-related outcomes, necessitating the maintenance of any changes over an extended
period [22, 23]. We pooled the effect sizes to derive a
composite metric for mental health. In line with the
assessment of sleep quality, we emphasized self-reported
measures of mental health above measures rated by
observers, as the personal perception of mental health
issues is undoubtedly the most significant.
Data pooling
Recent research has shown that improving sleep produces several therapeutic benefits. This study investigated the primary outcomes based on the inclusion
criteria. Language barriers were not considered during
study selection and participant screening. There were no
limitations regarding the number of participants eligible
for inclusion. A total of 35 letters, reviews, and editorials
were excluded from the analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the
full study selection process.
Eligibility of studies
The effects of the quality of sleep on adult mental wellness were being investigated. Only studies that discussed
how the applied interventions affected the occurrence of
various clinical outcomes were included in the conducted
sensitivity analyses. Subgroup assessments were also carried out.
Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria
Figure 1 serves as an in-depth summary of the investigation. Upon fulfillment of the inclusion criteria, the literature was included in the study [9, 13, 14]:
1. The study was an RCT and controlled prospective.
2. Adults were the subjects under investigation.
3. Validly assess the independent contribution of
changes in sleep on mental health outcomes among
adult populations.
4. The study examined the impact of sleep quality on
adult mental health [25].
We excluded non-comparative studies, studies with
incomplete data reporting, and studies reporting different outcomes.
Study identification
The PICOS framework was used to guide the development of the search strategy [28], as follows: P (population) Adult; Improving sleep was I (intervention). C
(comparison): included comparing sleep quality improvement to standard treatment [29]. O (outcome): mental
health illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, and psychological stress; S (study design): the study design was not
restricted. Using the keywords in Table 1, we conducted
a thorough search of the relevant databases through April
2025. Appraisals were conducted on all publications contained in a software for reference management, including
authors, titles, and abstracts. Furthermore, two authors
review articles to identify relevant tests [11, 12, 15].
Screening of studies and data collection
Each study was documented in a standardized format,
including key elements. Criteria employed to reduce 
Li et al. BMC Public Health (2025) 25:2992 Page 4 of 13
the data included the authors’ surname, the date of the
study, country of execution, the target population, the
overall number of subjects, clinical and therapeutic features, demographic details, and qualitative and quantitative assessment methods [30]. Two authors examined
the potential for bias in the research and the standards of
methodologies employed in the papers selected for supplemental analysis. The two authors performed impartial evaluations of the methodologies employed for each
examination [31].
In addition, we also extracted statistical data for effect
size calculation, information concerning the characteristics of the analyzed studies such as the publication status,
and study attributes (e.g., the target and control groups,
duration of follow-up), and the approach investigated
(e.g., type of intervention, mode of application) was also
recorded.
Statistical analysis
The mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using a continuous model
with random- or fixed-effects [16]. The calculated I2
index ranges from 0 to 100 and is represented as a percentage. Elevated I2
 levels indicate greater heterogeneity,
whereas diminished I2
 values reflect reduced heterogeneity [17]. If I2
 was 50% or more, we applied the random

effect; if not, the fixed effect was chosen [18, 31]. Bias was
determined using Egger’s statistical tests for quantitative
analysis, deemed present if P-value>0.05 using a twotailed method [32, 33]. Graphs and statistical analyses
were conducted using Review Manager 5.4. 31.
Results
Upon reviewing 2989 relevant papers, 54 studies published between 1998 and 2024 were deemed eligible and
included in this analysis [19–24, 27–73].
Table  2 summarizes the main characteristics of
these studies, which involved approximately 10,196
participants.
Improving sleep, as indicated by the validated questionnaire scores, was associated with significantly lower
levels of depressive symptoms (MD, −2.92; 95% CI: −3.61
to −2.24, P-value<0.001) with high levels of heterogeneity (I2=99%), and anxiety symptoms (MD, −1.14; 95%
CI: −1.32 to −0.97, P-value<0.001) with moderate levels
of heterogeneity (I2=50%) compared to standard care
among adults, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. However, no significant difference was detected in stress (MD, −1.03; 95%
CI: −2.31-0.25, P-value=0.11) with high heterogeneity
(I2=98%) between improved sleep quality and standard
care among adults, as shown in Fig. 4.
The quantitative results of the Egger regression test
and the graphical examination of the effect’s funnel plot
indicated no evidence of bias (p=0.86), as illustrated in
Figs.  5, 6 and 7. The majority of relevant examinations
were revealed to have inadequate practical quality and
exhibited bias in their selective reporting.
Discussion
For the current meta-analysis, 54 studies published
between 1998 and 2024 were included; these studies
involved 10,196 participants [19–24, 27–73].
The data analyzed revealed that improved sleep quality scores in validated questionnaires resulted in significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms
in adults compared to standard care. There was no significant change in stress levels between improved sleep
scores and conventional adult care. However, considering
that the majority of the research used a small sample size
(40 studies used sample sizes of less than 100 people), the
results should be interpreted with caution.
Due to a lack of primary research, it is premature
to draw definitive conclusions regarding other mental
health disorders (for example, suicidal ideation within
the psychotic spectrum, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout). A significant dose-response relationship was seen between alterations in sleep quality and
subsequent enhancements in mental health, indicating
that greater improvements in sleep correlate with more
substantial benefits in mental health [74]. The effects
persisted even after adjustments, despite some indication
of publication bias [75]. When considered as a whole,
the results highlight the connection between improved
sleep and better mental health, indicating a strong relationship between sleep deprivation and mental health
issues. The current research provides credence to the
notion that sleep hygiene benefits people of all backgrounds and demographics [76]. Regardless of concurrent mental and/or physical health issues, higher sleep
quality had a medium-sized and statistically significant
beneficial effect on composite mental health. Given the
difficulties in providing healthcare linked to multi-morbidity [77], as well as the tendency for mental and physical health issues to co-occur [78], which seems to be on
the rise [79]. According to the results of this study, it is
crucial that the benefits of getting more sleep for mental health also apply to people with co-occurring medical conditions. Additionally, studies have demonstrated
that getting more sleep can improve physical health outcomes like exhaustion [80], chronic pain [81], and general health-related quality of life [82]. It may also lower
medical expenses. Offering a digital cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to primary care patients, for
instance, was linked to significant cost savings [83]. Cost
savings resulting from sleep-related interventions have
also been documented in individuals with co-occurring
mental health conditions, such as depression [84]. This
implies that enhancing sleep may be beneficial for many
mental health conditions, expanding the potential effects
of sleep treatments in healthcare settings. Lastly, there is
mounting evidence that sleep disruptions are a predictor of future mental health issues. In patients at elevated
risk of psychosis, inadequately short duration and more
erratic sleep have been associated with increased severity of delusions and hallucinations. Implementing early
therapies that enhance sleep may mitigate the chance of
developing significant mental health issues. The recent
study discovered that enhancing sleep markedly benefits future mental wellness among individuals with nonclinical experiences. Mild-to-moderate mental health
concerns may eventually lead to more serious diagnoses [85]. Enhancing sleep may be one strategy that can
be used in conjunction with other strategies to reduce
the risk of transition. There are various advantages to
the current review. Firstly, it offers a thorough and current search and investigation of RCTs investigating the
impact of better sleep on a range of future mental healthrelated outcomes. In fact, this meta-analysis represents
one of the biggest studies to date that assesses the impact
of better sleep on mental health. Second, the purpose of
the meta-analysis was to examine the causal relationship
between sleep and mental health (i.e., only RCTs were
included, successful sleep quality improvement was necessary, there was a temporal lag between measures, etc.).

Although the general method has been utilized in other
domains, to our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the first
to employ it in the subject of sleep and mental health
[86]. Initially, only a small number of studies investigated
the long-term benefits of enhanced sleep. Extended follow-up studies usually revealed reduced effects (though
statistically significant); this is most likely owing to the
drugs’ fading impact on sleep quality over time [87].
As a result, it’s critical that sleep-quality programs
that aim to enhance mental health continue to have
positive impacts. Secondly, this evaluation included several outcomes for which few primary studies were available. Therefore, the conclusions we can draw for mental
health outcomes other than depression and anxiety
are more constrained in the absence of further studies
reporting these outcomes. Third, although the objective of this study was to encompass a broad spectrum of
sleep disorders, much of the research is based on cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for insomnia. This
may be due to the predominant focus of earlier studies

on the correlation between insomnia and mental health
[88]. This may be due to t. However, it is conceivable that
certain studies not explicitly focused on insomnia were
omitted due to our prioritization of sleep quality. The
concept of improvement differs among sleep disorders
and may not consider sleep quality. For instance, daytime drowsiness is a crucial finding in sleep apnea studies, and sleep timing plays a significant role in circadian
rhythm disorders. Future studies should examine how
treating particular sleep disorders affects mental health
by defining improvements in terms of outcomes unique
to those sleep disorders. The current evaluation identified a number of topics requiring further investigation in
the future, both theoretically and in terms of the application of research findings. First, future research should
examine the longer-term effects of improving sleep on
mental health, since the primary studies measured mental health on average about 20.5 weeks post-intervention,
and the effect of improved sleep on mental health significantly decreased over time. Second, most of the RCTs
in the current study were at high risk or had uncertain
risk of bias, which is not unusual. Consequently, we need
more research with a lower risk of methodological bias,
in addition to examining the long-term effects of better
sleep on a variety of mental health issues beyond anxiety

and depression. Lastly, while the current research indicates a causal relationship between sleep and mental
health, the precise mechanisms by which sleep influences mental health remain unclear. Whether and how
people control their emotions (e.g., in response to unfavorable outcomes) is one possible mechanism. In fact,
research indicates that insufficient sleep can worsen the
effects of unfavorable life events [89], lessen the positive
effects of favorable events [90], and be linked to a higher
frequency of emotion control techniques that may be
harmful to mental health [91]. Thus, while experimental
findings showed that induced sleep deprivation is negatively linked to worse emotional regulation [92], changes
in sleep patterns showed a prospective association with
changes in aspects of emotional regulation [92], even
though we are not aware of RCTs examining the impact
of improved sleep quality on emotional regulation. Contemporary theories of emotion regulation, like the action
control viewpoint, propose that managing emotions
involves three stages. The first step involves recognizing the need for regulation, choosing the approach and
scope of regulation, and putting a regulatory plan into
action [93]. These theories are based on studies on how
people control their behavior. We suggest that any or all
the activities implicated in efficiently regulating emotions
could be negatively impacted by poor sleep quality, which
could help to explain the connection between inadequate
sleep and mental wellness. In order to clarify the pathways by which increases in sleep improve mental health,
future studies using assessments of emotional regulation
features (e.g., the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation
Scale [88]) with longitudinal and experimental designs
are recommended. Evidence regarding the impact of
sleep on mental health also supports recommendations for regular screening of sleep disorders and their
treatment in terms of practice and implementation. The
Mental Health Foundation and the Royal Society for Public Health both advise that basic health care education
include knowledge of and proficiency in diagnosing sleep
disorders [94]. Not much progress has been made thus
far despite this and the increasing amount of data [95].
This might be due to the lack of adequate understanding of the significance of sleeping habits [75], inadequate
training and expertise in identifying and treating sleep
issues [96], and a lack of time and resources [75]. Therefore, investigating the obstacles and enablers to conducting sleep assessments and providing efficient therapies in
particular care settings—from the viewpoints of patients
and clinicians—might be a lucrative next step. The current study also brought to light the paucity of studies
Fig. 7 The effect’s funnel plot of the improvement in sleep on stress compared to standard care among adults
Li et al. BMC Public Health (2025) 25:2992 Page 11 of 13
examining the impact of sleep enhancement on mental
health outcomes in “real-world” contexts, such as within
already available clinical and community health services.
While some researchers are making significant progress
in this area [76], further clinical service intervention trials are obviously needed to fully understand the efficacy
and use of these strategies in normal care.
The meta-analysis had several limitations: Assortment
bias may have occurred due to the exclusion of certain
papers intended for inclusion. However, all excluded
studies failed to meet the requisite criteria for the analysis. Nonetheless, data on factors such as ethnicity, age,
and gender were essential to ascertain their influence on
outcomes. In addition, a high level of heterogeneity was
observed between outcomes. The potential sources of
heterogeneity might include the differences in the studies’ populations, differences in the types and durations
of sleep interventions, and the use of various tools to
assess sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We note that methodological differences may have
influenced impact sizes and contributed to the diversity
observed in our research. The objective of the study was
to elucidate the effect of sleep quality on adult mental
health. The use of imprecise or insufficient data from
prior research likely exacerbated bias. The individual’s
age, gender, ethnicity, and nutritional status were the
primary variables that likely contributed to discrimination. Unreported studies and inadequate data may have
unintentionally altered values. Contemporary theories
of emotion regulation, like the action control viewpoint,
propose that managing emotions involves three stages.
The first step involves recognizing the need for regulation, choosing the approach and scope of regulation, and
putting a regulatory plan into action.
Conclusions
The data showed that improving sleep led to significantly
lower depression and anxiety symptoms compared to
standard care among adults. Nevertheless, no significant
difference in stress levels was observed between the sleep
improvement and standard care groups. Though given
that most of the studies comprised a minor sample size
(40 studies utilizing sample sizes lower than 100 subjects), their values warrant careful consideration.
