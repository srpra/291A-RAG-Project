Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 10–25 exhibit an
increased prevalence of mental health disorders. Resilience has been well
established as a positive factor in promoting and protecting mental health. This
systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the correlation between
resilience and mental health in AYAs by including relevant observational studies.
Additionally, it explored potential moderators such as percentage of female
participants, sample regions, and resilience measurements.
Methods: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library,
Web of Science and Scopus databases was conducted until September 2024.
CMA 3.0 software was used to perform meta-analysis, publication bias and
sensitivity analysis of the included studies, and the moderating effect was
verified by meta-analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Result: Nineteen studies involving a total of 17,746 participants were included,
and the summary effect sizes from the random effect model showed that
resilience among AYAs had a correlation coefficient of -0.391 with negative
indicators of mental health (95% CI: - 0.469, - 0.308, p < 0.001), and a correlation
coefficient of 0.499 with positive indicators of mental health (95% CI: 0.400,
0.586, p < 0.001). Additionally, sample regions and resilience measurements
significantly moderated the correlation between resilience and positive
indicators of mental health.
Conclusion: Resilience in AYAs showed a moderately negative correlation with
negative indicators of mental health and a moderately strong positive correlation
with positive indicators of mental health. The findings strengthened the basis for
future resilience research in AYAs aged 10–25, highlighting the potential of
resilience to help mitigate the increasing mental health challenges faced by
this population.

1 Introduction
Recent statistics from the World Health Organization showed
that the prevalence of diagnosed mental health disorders among
adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 10-25 ranged between
10% - 20% (1). Mental health disorders refer to health conditions
that are characterized by significant changes or disturbances in
emotion, thinking, or behavior (2). The 10-25 age group
encompasses adolescents aged 10-19 and young adults aged 18-25
(3, 4), where mental health disorders drawn increasing public
attention and are now recognized as a critical global public health
issue (5, 6). In specific, approximately one in seven adolescents aged
10-19 suffers from mental health disorders, mainly anxiety and
depression, which account for 13% of the global burden of disease in
this age group (1). Among young adults aged 18-25, the prevalence
of major depressive episodes has risen sharply, increasing from
8.8% in 2005 to 15.2% in 2019, and the percentage of people with
severe impairment from major depressive episodes nearly doubling
from 5.2% to 10.3% during the decade from 2009 to 2019 (7).
Without timely intervention, these mental health disorders can
result in long-lasting adverse effects across individuals including
social isolation (8), unemployment (9), and substance abuse (10),
while significantly increasing the incidence of suicidal behaviors
among AYAs (11). Alarmingly, suicide has now become the second
leading cause of death among individuals aged 15-25 (12). The
consistent epidemiological evidence indicates that all major
syndromes constituting approximately 75% of mental health
disorders begin before the age of 25 (13). Therefore, prevention
and intervention mechanisms for mental health disorders in AYAs
aged 10-25 are urgently needed to effectively reduce the
disease burden.
Building resilience has received considerable attention from
researchers due to its crucial role in reducing the risk of mental
health disorders and promoting individual mental health (14). The
conceptualization and study of resilience initially emerged from
research on children at high risk for severe psychopathology (15).
Over time, resilience has been defined in various ways, including as
a personality trait that enables an individual to cope with adversity
and to achieve positive adjustment and development (16, 17), or as
a functional or behavioral outcome that overcomes and helps an
individual to recover from adversity (18, 19). However, we propose
a broader used definition of resilience as the ability and dynamic
process of maintaining or regaining mental health despite
experiencing adversity (20–22). Notably, many empirical studies
have demonstrated its effectiveness in coping with stress and
facilitating positive adaptations to protect the mental health of
individuals (23–28). Meanwhile, researchers have explored the
theoretical mechanisms underlying this positive effect, developing
models of the relationship between resilience and mental health that
incorporate mediating variables such as positive affect, perceived
social support (29), and coping strategies (30). Despite substantial
theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the relationship
between resilience and mental health (31–33), previous reviews
have paid relatively limited attention to AYAs, leaving the precise
strength of this association unclear. In fact, individuals aged 10-25
experience an increased biological stress response (34) which makes
them a highly susceptible group to various stressors (35). As a
result, this age group exhibits a dramatically increased prevalence of
mental health disorders (36). Examining the correlation between
resilience and mental health specifically within AYAs will be
beneficial in informing targeted resilience interventions. In
addition, the dual-factor model of mental health (37, 38)
emphasizes the need to evaluate mental health comprehensively.
This entails considering both the absence of negative
psychopathological indicators and the presence of positive
psychological indicators such as subjective well-being, life
satisfaction (39, 40). However, previous reviews have rarely
explored these aspects in an integrated manner. To address this
gap, our study attempts to conduct a more comprehensive
quantitative review that combines these dimensions, with a
particular focus on AYAs.
Potential moderators influencing the relationship between
resilience and mental health in AYAs warrant further
investigation. Building on previous studies, we focus on
examining the moderating effects of gender, sample regions, and
resilience measurements. First, regarding gender, researchers have
found that as the percentage of female participants increases, the
association between resilience and positive indicators of mental
health becomes stronger (41). Second, results observed in samples
from different regions often vary due to multiple influencing factors,
such as sociocultural differences between Western and Eastern
societies or disparities in the stages of resilience research (42, 43).
These factors may contribute to differences in the strength of the
relationship between resilience and mental health indicators. Lastly,
the diversity of resilience measurements, with their different
measurement properties, may influence the association between
resilience and mental health indicators, resulting in variations in the
observed outcomes (44).
In summary, this study aims to systematically quantify the
correlation between resilience and both positive and negative
indicators of mental health in AYAs through a review of the
literature, along with an exploration of some potential moderators
including percentage of female participants, sample regions, and
resilience measurements.
2 Methods
This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines, and was pre-registered in the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO;
ID: CRD42024604631).
2.1 Search strategy
We performed a systematic search in the following five
electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of
Science, and Scopus) and used a snowball strategy to find relevant
articles from their references and subsequent citations. The search
of literature was limited to the period covered from the inception of
Luo et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536553
Frontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org
each database till September 2024. The detailed search strategy is
provided in the Supplementary Material, as the PubMed interface.
2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The retrieved studies were included in the meta-analysis when
the following criteria were met: (1) published studies in English; (2)
the study types were observational studies, which included cohort
studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and
longitudinal studies reporting multiple cross-sections; (3) the
participants were AYAs aged 10-25 years; (4) measured resilience,
negative indicators (including symptoms of psychopathology and
negative affect such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar
and other reported mental health disorders or problems) or positive
indicators (including subjective well-being, life satisfaction, quality
of life etc.) of mental health; (5) reported Pearson’s correlation
coefficients (r) between resilience and the above indicators of
mental health.
The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) newspaper, conference
presentations, and review literature; (2) studies with incomplete or
unreported data; (3) non-observational studies and purely
descriptive studies.
2.3 Literature screening
Endnote X9 literature management software was used to detect
and exclude all the duplications. Then, two authors evaluated the
titles and abstracts of the remaining articles to ensure their
eligibility for inclusion in the study. No further review was
conducted for articles that met the exclusion criteria. After that,
the two authors reviewed the full texts of the eligible literature.
During this process, any disagreements were discussed to reach a
resolution, or addressed by consulting another author.
2.4 Data extraction and quality assessment
After literature screening, the two authors reviewed the full text
for data extraction. The following information of each included
study was extracted: author, country, mean age, gender, resilience
measurements, and mental health measurements of both negative
and positive indicators, as well as Pearson’s correlation coefficient
between resilience and both indicators of mental health. Separate
extractions were performed if several different samples were
investigated in the same study.
The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist
for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies was applied for quality
assessment (45). This checklist consists of 8 items, each of which
includes four answers (“yes,” “no,” “unclear,” and “not applicable”).
Each “yes” answer corresponds to one point and the rest of the
answers are assigned no points, with the points summed to give a
total score for each study. Converting the total score to percentages,
we rated studies scoring 70% and above as high quality, studies
scoring 50% to < 70% as moderate quality, and studies scoring less
than 50% as low quality (46).
2.5 Data analysis
All statistical analyses of our study were performed using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.0 (CMA 3.0) software.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the
correlation between resilience and both negative and positive
indicators of mental health. First, we converted r values to
Fisher’s Z by using the formula Fisher’s Z = 0.5 ln [(1 + r)/(1-r)].
The values obtained were then weighted according to the sample
size using the formula SEz = (1/(n-3))1/2. Finally, all values were
converted to r by the formula Summary r = (e2z – 1)/(e2z + 1) to
evaluate the correlation between resilience and mental health. In
addition, according to (47), r = 0.1 represented low correlation, r =
0.3 represented moderate correlation, and r = 0.5 and above
represented strong correlation. All mean effect sizes were
calculated by averaging the correlation coefficients of all
independent samples, weighted by their inverse variance.
Heterogeneity test was conducted using Cochran’s Q and I2
statistics (48). The fixed effect model was used to summarize the
effects when I2 < 50%; otherwise, the random effect model was more
appropriate for the analysis of the effect sizes from the existing
literature (49). Moreover, a meta-analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used on categorical variables to test whether it was possible to
moderate the correlation between resilience and mental health. The
moderating variables in this study were identified based on insights
from the existing literature, including the percentage of female
participants, sample regions, and resilience measurements. The
differences between and within groups were assessed by the Q
test, and groups with fewer than 3 studies (k < 3) were removed due
to concerns regarding under-representation and limited statistical
reliability. Funnel plots and Egger’s linear regression (50) were used
to evaluate publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted
to test the robustness of the results of this study.
3 Results
3.1 Literature selection
We retrieved 2581 records from the database in the initial
literature search. After removing 1020 duplicates, 11 non-English
literature and 9 conference abstracts, 1541 studies were retained.
Title and abstract screening excluded 1255 articles that did not
match our requirements in terms of sample or topic. The remaining
286 articles were screened in full text, and 267 articles were excluded
due to unavailability of data, inappropriate article type, and not
reporting Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Finally, a total of 19
studies were included in the current review. Figure 1 shows the flow
chart of literature selection process.

Frontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org
3.2 Study characteristics
The 19 included studies, involving a total of 17746 participants,
were conducted between 2011-2024, with more than half of them
conducted in the last three years. The detailed characteristics of the
included studies are shown in Table 1. Five studies were from China
(mainland and HK), three from Spain, two from Norway and
Poland, and one each from Malaysia, Nigeria, Canada, Japan,
Saudi Arabia, USA, Germany and India. All studies measured
both resilience and mental health, and reported Pearson’s
correlation coefficient. The CD-RISC was utilized in three studies,
while four studies applied the short version (CD-RISC-10). Of the
remaining studies, three utilized READ and RS, two used BRS, and
PIES, PSS/GHQ, CYRM, CPYDS, RSCA. Out of the 19 included
studies, twelve studies measured the negative indicators of mental
health, including anxiety, depression, perceived stress, burnout, etc.
However, thirteen involved the assessment of various positive
indicators of mental health, such as quality of life, life satisfaction,
psychological well-being, hope, optimism, self-efficacy.
3.3 Effect size and heterogeneity
3.3.1 The summary correlation between
resilience and negative indicators of
mental health
Data from 12132 AYAs were included in the 12 studies. The
results of the heterogeneity test showed a high level of heterogeneity
among the included studies (Q = 266.615, p < 0.001, I2 = 95.874%).
Therefore, we calculated the mean weighted effect size (r), sample
size (k), and 95% confidence intervals using a random effect
model (Table 2). The results showed a moderately negative
correlation between resilience and negative indicators of mental
health (r = - 0.391, 95% CI: - 0.469, - 0.308, p < 0.001; see Figure 2).
3.3.2 The summary correlation between
resilience and positive indicators of mental health
The correlations between resilience and positive indicators of
mental health were reported in 13 studies, involving 13135 AYAs.
The results of the heterogeneity test were similar to the negative

indicators, demonstrating high heterogeneity (Q = 536.259; p < 0.001;
I
2 = 97.762%). The effect size calculated by the random effect model
(Table 2) revealed a moderately strong positive correlation between
resilience and positive indicators of mental health among the AYAs
(r = 0.499, 95% CI: 0.400, 0.586, p < 0.001; see Figure 3).
3.4 Quality assessment
The quality of included cross-sectional studies was assessed
using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical CrossSectional Studies, which has been well-validated and considered the
most commonly used tool for assessing bias in analytical crosssectional studies (71). Two authors independently assessed the
quality of each study, and any disagreements were resolved
through discussions at group meetings. A total of 16 studies
received scores above 70%, classifying the majority of the
included studies as high quality. Among the remaining three
studies, two were categorized as moderate quality, while one was
classified as low quality. The detailed results of each included study
are shown in the Supplementary Material.
3.5 Moderator analyses
The current study used meta-analysis of variance (ANOVA) to
test the moderating effects of three variables below: percentage of
female participants, sample regions, and resilience measurements.
Results from the moderator analyses are presented in Tables 3.
In terms of the positive indicators of mental health, the sample
regions and the resilience measurements significantly moderated
the correlation between resilience and mental health (sample
regions: QBET = 11.338, p < 0.001, resilience measurements:
QBET = 69.932, p < 0.001). More specifically, Studies from
Western countries reported the stronger correlation between
resilience and mental health (Western: r = 0.589, 95% CI: 0.494,
0.670, p < 0.001, Eastern: r = 0.380, 95% CI: 0.304, 0.452, p < 0.001).
For resilience measurements, the RS scale reported stronger

correlations than CD-RISC scale and other scales (RS: r = 0.579,
95% CI: 0.335, 0.750, p < 0.001, CD-RISC: r = 0.467, 95% CI: 0.366,
0.557, p < 0.001, Others: r = 0.371, 95% CI: 0.212, 0.512, p < 0.001),
while the READ scale group was excluded due to a small sample size
of less than 3 studies (k=1). However, percentage of female
participants did not have a significant moderating effect on the
correlation between resilience and mental health. Regarding the
negative indicators of mental health, none of the sample regions,
percentage of female participants, or resilience measurements were
found to significantly modulate the correlation (p>0.05).
3.6 Publication bias and sensitivity analysis
The present meta-analysis evaluated publication bias using
funnel plots and Egger linear regression. The funnel plot provided
insufficient evidence of the symmetrical distribution of effect sizes
for both negative and positive indicators (Figures 4, 5). Therefore,
Egger linear regression was utilized to provide more reliable
evidence. The p-values of the results indicate that there were no
significant publication biases for both indicators (negative
indicators: t = 1.965, p = 0.077; positive indicators: t = 1.545, p =
0.151). The sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing the
included samples one by one, and a significant shift in the effect
sizes would represent a lack of non-robustness. However, our
results indicated that the effect sizes of resilience and both
indicators of mental health in AYAs were stable, therefore, the
results of this meta-analysis were robust (Figures 6, 7).
4 Discussion
The current study aimed to systematically summarize the
evidence on the correlation between resilience and both negative
and positive indicators of mental health in AYAs. A total of 19
studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the results revealed
a moderately negative correlation between resilience and negative
indicators of mental health (r = - 0.391), and a moderately strong

positive correlation with positive indicators of mental health (r =
0.499). Specifically, higher resilience was correlated with reduced
levels of perceived stress, anxiety, burnout, and depression,
alongside enhanced mental well-being, quality of life, life
satisfaction, self-esteem, and self-efficacy among AYAs. These
findings are consistent with previous empirical studies covering
similar age groups (56, 72–77). Further, in terms of the strength of
the correlation, resilience was more strongly correlated with
positive indicators of mental health than negative indicators, also
supported by the previous evidence (78, 79).
This systematic review provides preliminary evidence on the
correlation between resilience and mental health in AYAs.
Specifically, this age group encompasses adolescence, from 10 to
19 years old, and emerging adulthood, from 18 to 25 years old,
covering a critical developmental stage that spans the transition
from education to early social integration. This period is
foundational for establishing lifelong health and facilitating
personal and professional development (3, 4). Uniquely, this stage
is characterized by intensified academic pressure and increased
challenges in building and maintaining relationships, which
distinguish it from childhood. Meanwhile, the urgency to acquire
advanced skills for societal survival exceeds that observed in middle
adulthood (80). As a result, this is the period when individuals are
most threatened by psychosocial stressors and are vulnerable to
mental health disorders (81), which adversely affect academic and
occupational achievement, interpersonal relationship formation,

self-identity, etc. (36). Over time, untreated mental health disorders
during this critical stage may produce long-lasting negative
consequences for individuals, including reduced workforce
participation, lower incomes, and diminished living standards in
later adulthood (82). The more individuals affected, the greater the
likelihood of harm at the economic and cultural levels of society.
As highlighted by the World Health Organization, fostering
resilience has been an integral part of the strategy for preventing
mental health disorders (83), The findings of this study reinforce
the significant role of resilience in helping AYAs reduce negative
indicators of psychopathology and enhance positive mental health
states. These results are supported by relevant empirical studies. In
terms of the elimination of negative indicators, resilience has been
shown to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety in
adolescents (84), reduces the after-effects of psychological trauma,
and curbs suicidal ideation in young adults (85, 86). Conversely,
lower resilience leads to a heightened risk of various mental health
disorders (87). In terms of the promotion of positive indicators,
resilient adolescent individuals perceive increased life satisfaction
(51), possess better emotional regulation to manage negative
emotions and prefer positive coping strategies to achieve social
adaptation (88). Furthermore, resilience positively affects all
dimensions of quality of life (89), while life satisfaction, perceived
well-being, and self-efficacy are all negatively affected
when resilience is low (90). Although the exact mechanisms that
resilience promotes mental health remain complicated (91),
resilience theory provides a well-established framework to explain
its effects. Resilience facilitates mental health by enabling
individuals to counteract the negative consequences of exposure
to risk factors. This process involves leveraging environmental,

Frontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org
social, and personal protective factors to interrupt the progression
from risk exposure to pathological outcomes (33). In specific,
through the mobilization of these internal and external protective
factors, individuals are able to face up to adverse life events and
learn from their struggles to achieve further growth and positive
cognitive development (92). As a result, individuals might avoid
psychological dysfunction (31), be less likely to suffer from
detrimental mental health outcomes (93), and raise the positive
indicators such as the perceived well-being (32, 94) to contribute to
the promotion of overall mental health (95–97). Additionally,
similar positive effects have been explored through theoretical
mechanisms. For instance, resilience can promote post-traumatic
growth through the mediating effects of internal factors, such as
positive emotions, and external factors, such as social support (98).
Given the alarming mental health challenges faced by AYAs and the
rising demand for effective mental health interventions (99), the
results of this study provide a strong referential basis for developing
targeted interventions that leverage resilience as a protective and
promotive factor for mental health.
This study explored the moderators influencing the correlation
between resilience and mental health in AYAs, including percentage of
female participants, sample regions, and resilience measurements. First,
we found that sample regions moderated the correlation between
resilience and positive indicators of mental health, whereas no such
moderating effect was observed for negative indicators. Similar results
have been found in previous studies, though the specifics vary (100).
Our findings revealed that the correlations reported in studies
conducted in Western countries were stronger than those from
Eastern countries. The perspective of sociocultural differences
between Western and Eastern societies may offer a potential
explanation for this finding. Current researches and measurements
of resilience are predominantly based on cognitive or individual-level
characteristics (81), which align more closely with the individualistic
cultural context of Western countries (101). In contrast, within the
collectivist cultural context of Eastern societies, connections to broader
social systems surrounding the individual should also be considered as
a key dimension of resilience (102). However, only a limited number of
scales in the existing literature have incorporated this aspect. Moreover,
this finding may also be attributed to varying levels of awareness of the
resilience concept. Greater awareness of resilience tends to foster
positive attitudes and adaptive behaviors, which, in turn, strengthen
the association between resilience and mental health outcomes (103).
Given that the concept of resilience originated in Western contexts and
has been studied across disciplines as early as the beginning of the 21st
century (20), it is likely more established in Western cultures compared
to Eastern ones (101), leading to the present findings of this study.
However, in recent years, efforts to localize and adapt the concept of
resilience within Eastern cultural frameworks have gained momentum,
presenting promising opportunities for advancing cross-cultural
resilience research (92, 104, 105).
Second, resilience measurements also moderated the
correlations between resilience and positive indicators of mental
health in AYAs. Specifically, although the CD-RISC scale was
considered the more commonly used instruments for assessing
resilience (106), the RS scale yielded higher correlation coefficients
in the studies included. One potential explanation is that in terms of
applicability to the participant populations, the RS scales (including
short versions) are considered to be more appropriate for the
adolescent population, as well as possessing cross-age applicability
(107). By contrast, the CD-RISC has shown better measurement
properties when including general population and clinical samples,
making it more applicable in the clinical practice through resilience
interventions (16). In addition, the stability of the scales’ factor
structure may also serve as a potential explanation for the findings.
For instance, the original version of the CD-RISC-25 demonstrated
instability in its proposed five-factor structure (16). Many
researchers have reported that it is better represented by a threefactor structure (108) or one general factor (109). In contrast, the RS
scale has consistently maintained its solid one-factor measure of
resilience (81). Concerning the negative indicators of mental health,
we did not find a moderating effect of the resilience measurements.
Finally, while prior studies reported that a higher percentage of
female participants strengthened the correlation between resilience
and mental health (41, 84), this effect was not observed in our
analysis when the percentage of female participants was higher
(>50%) in either the positive or the negative indicators. This
discrepancy may be explained by the limited number of included
studies, necessitating cautious interpretation and future research to
validate the findings.
5 Limitations and future directions
Although conducted in strict accordance with the relevant
standards and procedures, the current meta-analysis has several
limitations as follows. First, we used only Pearson’s correlation
coefficient to measure effect sizes, which limited the number of
studies we included in the meta-analysis and thus might affect the
validity and generalization of the results. Future studies should consider
incorporating other metrics such as phi-coefficient, point-biserial
correlation, and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient as well.
Second, potential moderators were not comprehensive enough as we
only considered percentage of female participants, sample regions, and
resilience measurements. Future studies should take sufficient account
of other variables, such as educational attainment, ethnicity, and
adversity factors, all of which may influence the relationship between
resilience and mental health in AYAs, particularly adversity factors.
Finally, our meta-analysis, based mainly on cross-sectional studies, was
not able to provide an explanation for the causal relationship between
resilience and mental health among AYAs. Therefore, future research
should prioritize the use of longitudinal study designs. For instance,
tracking resilience and mental health indicators across multiple time
points while addressing confounding factors can provide valuable
insights into their potential causal relationships.
6 Conclusions
The current meta-analysis included 19 studies on the correlation
between resilience and mental health in AYAs. Our results indicated
that resilience showed a moderately negative correlation with negative
indicators of mental health and a moderately strong positive
Luo et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536553
Frontiers in Psychiatry 11 frontiersin.org
correlation with positive indicators of mental health. Additionally, the
strength of the correlation between resilience and positive indicators of
mental health was moderated by sample regions and resilience
measurements. By extending the application of the two-factor model
of mental health, this study demonstrated that previous findings on the
correlation between resilience and mental health in other age groups
are also applicable to AYAs aged 10-25. This provides a more direct
and robust basis for future studies of resilience in this population.
Therefore, we advocate for the further exploration of targeted
resilience-building interventions and strategies in school and
workplace settings, which could effectively help to mitigate the
increasing mental health challenges faced by AYAs.
