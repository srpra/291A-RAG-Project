Abstract
Purpose of Review The prevalence of diabetes is rising around the world and represents an important public health concern.
Unlike individual-level risk and protective factors related to the etiology of diabetes, contextual risk factors have been much
less studied. Identification of contextual factors related to the risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries may help health professionals, researchers, and policymakers to improve
surveillance, develop policies and programs, and allocate funding.
Recent Findings Among 4,470 potential articles, 48 were included in this review. All reviews were published in English
between 2005 and 2023 and were conducted in over 20 different countries. This review identified ten upstream contextual
risk factors related to type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk, including income, employment, education, immigration, race/ethnicity,
geography, rural/urban status, built environment, environmental pollution, and food security/environment.
Summary The ten upstream contextual risk factors identified this review may be integrated into diabetes research, surveillance and prevention activities to help promote better outcomes for people at risk or living with diabetes in OECD countries.
Additional research is needed to better quantify the measures of associations between emerging key contextual factors and
diabetes outcomes.

Introduction
Prevalence of diabetes has risen around the world and represents an important public health concern. While there
is no cure, advances in pharmacotherapy and behavioural
interventions have improved management such that people
are living longer healthier lives with diabetes. Globally,
approximately 10.5% of adults were living with diabetes in
2021, and this is expected to rise to 12.2% by 2045 [1].
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organisation collaborating with its 38 member countries who share similar economic structures and health system frameworks to establish
international standards on a variety of key global issues,
including improving public health. On average, across
OECD countries, 6.9% of adults were living with diabetes
in 2021, with age-standardized prevalence rates exceeding
higher than 10% in some countries [2].
Approximately 90% of all diabetes diagnoses are type 2
diabetes (T2D), 9% are type 1 diabetes (T1D), and 1% are
other types of diabetes [3]. T2D results from a wide range
of modifiable and non-modifiable individual, social, and
ecological factors. It can often be prevented or delayed and
commonly affects adults [4, 5]. Conversely, T1D is an autoimmune disease, which cannot be prevented. Other types of
diabetes include gestational diabetes, and types secondary
to gene mutations, medications, or other medical conditions
[5].
The risk and management of diabetes are affected by a
combination of individual characteristics and behaviours,
and upstream contextual factors stemming from the social,
economic, and physical environments [6]. Individuallevel risk factors have been extensively studied and often

concentrate on downstream aspects of health care, while
upstream contextual factors are not well understood. Examples of upstream contextual factors include built environment, socioeconomic status, and culture [7]. A recent study
examining geographic areas with high diabetes related
mortality described these clusters as being less economically favourable, with high rates of unemployment and poor
access to social services [8]. Moreover, Cunningham et al.
[9] reported that 42% of the variation in diabetes incidence
across the U.S. could be explained by socioeconomic and
health inequalities such as higher unemployment rates,
higher poverty rates, and longer commute times. A better
understanding of upstream contextual factors related to diabetes risk is important to inform effective surveillance systems, public health policies, and programs to help reduce
the risk of diabetes and improve the lives of those with the
condition [10]. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review
of reviews was to summarize the impact of upstream contextual factors related to the risk of T1D and T2D among
OECD countries and to enhance diabetes surveillance activities through the application of health equity principles. We
focused our review on OECD countries as they share a common goal of improving population health through a large
range of determinants of health including upstream contextual factors [2], leading to a potentially greater amount of
research on the topic.
Methods
Design
Registration of this systematic review was performed through
the International Prospective Register of Systematic Review
(PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020148159)
in adherence to the Population, Exposure, Comparisons,
Outcomes, and Study design framework (PECO) [11] (see
Table 1), and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [12].
Search Strategy
The search strategy was developed in partnership with
the Health Library of Health Canada [13]. Embase and
Medline were systematically searched using key words
related to diabetes risk (e.g., diabetes incidence, diabetes
prevalence) in OECD countries. Any type of review (e.g.,
systematic, meta-analysis, narrative) that reported on rates
of diabetes as they relate to contextual factors were eligible for inclusion. The term ‘contextual factor’ was defined
as physical, societal, and environmental factors that are
associated with health outcomes. Reviews presenting data
exclusively on individual factors (e.g., genetic, individual wealth) related to diabetes risk, diabetes treatment or
diagnosis practices, reviews from non-OECD countries,
unpublished reviews, conference abstracts, and reviews
published in languages other than English or French
were excluded. To ensure factors were relevant to current
policy considerations, only reviews published since 1999
were eligible for inclusion. Within a given review, there
were no date restrictions, and no exclusions with respect
to characteristics of study participants, besides the fact
that over 70% needed to be from OECD countries. Only
reviews presenting data exclusively on T1D and/or T2D
were included. All records were imported to RefWorks
software where duplicates were removed. The search was
completed on June 12, 2023.
Study Selection
Four reviewers (AL, SPH, HH, HG) screened titles and
abstracts using Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd, Australia) and Microsoft Excel 2010. Reviews
identified as potentially relevant by at least one reviewer
were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Discrepancies were
resolved by consensus.
Table 1  PECO criteria
Population Review must include no more than 30% of publications from non-OECD countries.
No exclusions with respect to age, gender, or ethnicity.
Exposure Any contextual variables associated with diabetes (physical, sociocultural, political and economic environments).
Comparator None required
Outcomes Measures of association:
• Risk ratio (RR): The risk of diabetes in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group.
• Odds ratio (OR): The odds of diabetes in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group.
Descriptive Measures:
• Prevalence of diabetes (total proportion of cases in a population)
• Incidence of diabetes (number of new cases, as a proportion or rate, in a given time period)
Current Diabetes Reports (2025) 25:19 Page 3 of 13 19
Data Extraction
Data were extracted in Microsoft Excel 2010 by three
reviewers (SPH, HH, HG), using a standardized and pilottested data collection tool. Information extracted included
study author(s), publication date, study design, study country, number of primary articles included in review, study
population, diabetes type(s), and contextual factor(s).
Reviewers were not blinded to study details.
Data Synthesis
A narrative synthesis of each review was conducted. Where
possible, study statistics were reported as prevalence (%),
summary statistic (i.e. RR, OR), including 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Each study could include multiple contextual
factors.
Quality Assessment
Systematic reviews were scored with the AMSTAR 2 tool
[14] as high quality (no, or one non-critical weakness), moderate quality (more than one non-critical weakness), low
quality (one critical weakness, or several non-critical weaknesses), or critically low quality (more than one critical flaw
with or without non-critical weaknesses). Narrative reviews
or papers without clear methods selection were evaluated
with the SANRA tool [15] as high quality (score≥10), moderate quality (7≤score<10), low quality (4≤score<9) or
critically low quality (score<4).
Results
Review Selection
After de-duplication, the search yielded 3,624 articles.
A total of 309 were retained for full-text review and 48
were included in this overview (Fig. 1). Characteristics of
included reviews are available in Table 2.
Quality Assessment
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (n=26) were evaluated with the AMSTAR 2 tool. Almost all (n=18) were
assessed as critically low quality, five as low quality and
three as moderate quality. Narrative reviews or reviews with
no clear methods (n=22) were evaluated using the SANRA
tool. Five ranked as high quality, ten as moderate and seven
as low quality. Quality assessment of included reviews are
available in Table 2.
Summary of Findings
Key contextual factors identified in the literature included
income, employment, education, immigration, race/ethnicity, geography, rural/urban status, built environment, environmental pollution, as well as food security/environment.
A summary of findings by contextual factor of interest is
included in Table 3.

Socioeconomic Status
Socioeconomic status, measured via income, employment,
or education, was consistently associated with increased risk
of T2D. Agardh et al. [16] reported an overall increased risk
of T2D in low socioeconomic groups whether measured by
income (40%), education level (41%), or occupation (31%).
Although there is considerable overlap between income,
employment, and education, results are presented separately
as much as possible.
Income (
n
=13)
Borchers et al. [17] reported that rates of T1D vary consid
-
erably but incidence is lowest in areas of highest material
deprivation. High population density and household crowd
-
ing provided a better predictive model than global measures
of socioeconomic deprivation. Incidence of T1D correlates
most strongly with indicators of national prosperity such as
gross domestic product and low infant mortality, although
these results may be at least partially influenced by differ
-
ences between urban and rural areas which may only serve
as proxies for environmental and lifestyle factors.
Results from reviews focused on T2D suggest an
increased risk of diabetes in the lower income groups. At the
regional level, Rathmann and colleagues [18] reported that
the unemployment rate and the regional economic climate
of the governing body was associated with T2D prevalence.
Using an Index of Multiple Deprivation, the DIAB-CORE
consortium confirmed that diabetes is more prevalent in
economically weaker regions and increases with unemploy
-
ment and poorly built environment [18]. Castro et al. [19]
suggests that environmental factors such as impoverished
neighborhoods are an important modifiable risk factor for
T2D. Maier et al. [20] found that the risk of T2D was greater
in lowest income groups compared to highest (OR 2.08, 95%
CI 1.63–2.65), and in most deprived groups, compared to
the least deprived (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.47–4.04). In subgroup analysis by income level of high-income countries,
low education level and low-income occupation level were
associated with a 45% and a 31% increased risk of T2D,
respectively [16]. Poverty or low socioeconomic status was
found to increase the risk of incident T2D and related com

plications [21]. Data from a Canadian study illustrated a 14%
higher incidence of T2D in Ontario in the lowest income
quintile relative to the highest (8.26 per 1,000 vs. 7.25 per
1,000), with consistent findings across all ages and sexes [22]. Some populations are overrepresented in lower paying

Employment (n=4)
Ferrie et al. [25] reported that high job insecurity at
baseline was associated with an increased risk of T2D
in the age- and sex-adjusted analysis compared with low
job insecurity (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09–1.30). This also
remained significant after adjusting for socioeconomic status, obesity, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use
(OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.24). Oldroyd et al. [26] reported
higher age- and sex-standardized mortality rates for T1D
and T2D in manual workers than in non-manual workers, independently of socioeconomic position. Based on
income level of occupation, the lowest earning employment groups showed highest risk of T2D compared to
the highest earning employment groups (RR 1.31, 95%
CI 1.09–1.57) [16]. Martinez-Carsodo et al. [23] also
reported that immigrants account for 30% of the uninsured
population and tend to work in sectors without healthcare
access. Thus, they are less likely to use healthcare, and are
at increased risk of having undiagnosed (OR 3.74, 95%
CI 2.29–6.08) or uncontrolled diabetes (OR 1.94, 95 CI
1.31–2.88), compared to non-immigrant populations.
Education (n=6)
All included reviews reported a significant inverse relationship between education and risk of diabetes [16,
20–23, 27]. For example, among Hispanics living in the
US, prevalence of diabetes was 15% for those with less
than a high school diploma, compared to only 7% among
those with a bachelor’s degree or higher [21]. Agardh
et al. [26] showed that T2D risk was significantly higher
in the lowest, compared to the highest education group
(RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.28–1.51). Similarly, Maier et al. [20]
reported an increased risk of diabetes for those with low
compared to medium/high education levels (OR 1.99, 95%
CI 1.71–2.32).

Summary of findings
Income n=13(6) Inverse association between income and incidence and prevalence rates of diabetes, such
that diabetes disproportionately affects those in lower income groups [16, 17, 18, 19,
21, 22, 61, 23, 20, 27, 24, 50, 46].
Employment n=4(2) Incidence of diabetes was higher among those who reported high job insecurity and
among low occupation groups [16,23,25,26].
Education n=6(3) Significant inverse relationship between education and prevalence of diabetes, although
this may be at least partially mediated by income [16,21,22,23,20,27].
Immigration n=10(3) Recent immigration, and increased level of acculturation are associated with increased
prevalence of diabetes. This may be mediated by income of native country [19,21,23,2
8,34,29,31,32,33,30].
Race and ethnicity n=17(4) Incidence and prevalence of both T1D, and T2D are higher among some race and ethnic
groups [17,22,26,32,33,43,38,37,39,40,41,45,52,28,62,42,44].
Geography n=4(2) Most adults living with T2D were from China, India, USA, Russia, Indonesia, Japan, and
Mexico [46]. Highest rates of T2D in youth were in the Western Pacific Region and
in the World Bank upper-middle-income countries [47]. T1D incidence is highest in
countries furthest from the Ecuador [48,49]
Rural and urban status n=9(4) For T1D, decreased population density is associated with increased rate of disease,
although this may be dependent of geographical location. For T2D, rates of diabetes
are higher in more rural areas and in high density urban areas among at risk ethnic
populations, although this may be mediated by socioeconomic status, genetics, or both
[17,50,31,43,37,27,51,22,32].
Built environment n=5(1) Evidence suggesting that an environment that promotes walkability, access to greenspaces, and safe and connected streets is associated with lower levels of obesity and
higher levels of physical activity, which in
turn may impact rates of diabetes [19,23,45,52,53].
Environmental pollution n=10(6) Evidence suggesting that some environmental pollutants (air, food, and noise) are related
to increased incidence and prevalence of diabetes, but this evidence is not definitive
[18,37,27,54,63,57,55,56,58].
Food security and environment n=11(4) Inverse relationship between diet quality and prevalence rates of diabetes. Food insecurity also plays and important role in the risk of diabetes [22,30,33,37,45,51,64,60,59,1
9,52].

Immigration, Race and Ethnicity
In many cases, it was difficult to disentangle discussion
about immigration, race and ethnicity due to the inherent
complexity of these terms and confounding variables. Often,
all three concepts were used to calculate acculturation index,
which are delineated in the next sections. These concepts
were defined by the authors of each review to reflect the
unique racial and ethnic composition of their study population, shaped by the region’s historical context, current sociopolitical landscape, and geographical characteristics.
Immigration (n=10)
In most reviews, immigration was defined as time since
arrival, country of origin, parents’ country of origin, or ethnic background. Overall, it appeared that time since arrival
was correlated with prevalence of diabetes. Adhikari et al.
[28] reported a higher prevalence of diabetes among immigrants living in Canada for 15 years or more (male OR 1.52;
female OR 1.40) compared to residents of 5 to 9 years. In
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway, prevalence of T2D
was highest among immigrants of non-OECD countries, followed by immigrants of OECD countries; non-immigrants
had the lowest rates of diabetes [29]. Results were similar
from other reviews with higher reports of diabetes prevalence and incidence rates among non-European migrants
compared to European born people [30–32]. Length of residence in the US was positively correlated with prevalence of
T2D, suggesting that immigrants’ health worsens with time
spent in the US [23, 33].
Acculturation, or the level to which immigrants adopt
attitudes, values, customs, beliefs, and behaviours of a new
culture, may also help to explain disease risk [34]. Acculturation is often calculated as an index based on proxy
indicators such as birthplace, language use, and number of
years spent in a new country. Low levels of acculturation
were associated with better health, including lower rates of
T2D among Latinos in the US [34]. Based on results from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study in the
US, Aguayo-Mazzucato et al. [21] reported increased risk of
T2D corresponding to the level of acculturation with scores
ranging from 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest). After adjusting for
socio-demographic factors, the study found an increased
risk of T2D for acculturation scores of 1 (OR 1.71, 95% CI
1.31–2.23), of 2 (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.11–2.39) and of 3 (OR
2.05, 95% CI 1.27–3.29) compared to those with a score of
0. Also, Castro et al. [19] reported that T2D prevalence was
significantly associated with acculturation in non-Mexican
Latinos, but not in Mexican-origin Latinos nor in people of
Chinese origin. Finally, English proficiency among Indian
and Bangladeshi UK migrants was associated with a lower
prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes [35].
Race and Ethnicity (n=17)
Although sometimes used interchangeably, race categorizes
people solely based on their physical characteristics, while
ethnicity is a multi-dimensional concept that categorizes
people based on their culture, religion, language, nationality, geographic origin, etc [36]. Highest rates of T1D were
found in Nordic countries and lowest rates were found in
Asian, Caribbean, and southern European countries [37].
Outside of Nordic countries, prevalence of T1D seems to
be highest among non-Hispanic whites compared to other
ethnic groups. This may be due to European ancestry of this
group in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand [17].
On the other hand, T2D prevalence was two to three times
higher among minority ethnic groups in the UK, compared
to the white British population [32]. Moreover, several
reviews have shown rates of T2D to be lowest in non-Hispanic whites and highest among South Asians [22, 26, 28,
33, 38–41]. For example, in a pooled analysis, Meeks et al.
[38] reported that compared to people of European descent,
South Asians had the highest risk of T2D (OR 3.7, 95% CI
2.7–5.1), followed by people of Middle Eastern and North
African, Sub-Saharan African, Western Pacific, and South
and Central American descent. According to Agyemang
et al. [40], migrants living in Europe have an increased risk
of T2D compared to the general population: South Asia (OR
3.7, CI 95% 2.7–5.1); Middle East (OR 2.7, CI 95%1.8–3.9);
North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa (OR 2.6, CI 95% 2.0–3.5)
and South and Central America (OR 1.3, CI 95% 1.1–1.6).
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was also higher among
Indigenous people in Canada [22, 28], in the United-States
[42] and in Australia [43] compared to other ethnic groups.
Multiple and complex contextual factors have been contributing to the increased risk of diabetes in the indigenous
population in Canada, including the impact of centuries of
colonization and marginalization, and other environmental,
sociocultural, socioeconomic, and biological/genetic factors
[44]. Durazo et al. [45] examined the neighbourhood concentration of race and ethnic minority groups and although
results were mixed, some studies indicated that residents
of ethnic enclaves exhibit better health than those living
outside.
Environment
Geography (n=4)
The burden of T2D was found to increase generally in countries with a growth and ageing population. Most adults living
with T2D were from China and India (40%), USA and Russia
(10%), and Indonesia, Japan, and Mexico (12%) [46]. Most
youth living with T2D were from the Western Pacific Region
(30%) and from the World Bank upper-middle-income 
Current Diabetes Reports (2025) 25:19 Page 9 of 13 19
countries (40%). Countries with highest incidence of T2D
in youth were China, India, and United States [47]. T1D
rates were found to be highest in countries furthest from the
equator such as Northern Europe Australia, New Zealand,
Northern America and Northern Africa [48, 49].
Rural and Urban Status (n=9)
Borchers et al. [17] found that T1D prevalence was highest
in areas with lower population density, such as rural areas.
For T2D, evidence shows that rural areas tend to have higher
rates compared to urban areas, although this may be related
partially to socioeconomic status and the presence of risk
factors for diabetes, like obesity [31, 37, 50]. A few authors
[22, 31] suggest that economic development and rapid
urbanization in low to middle-income countries have contributed to increasing rates of diabetes. Within Canada, they
reported geographic variation, with the lowest rates in Western Canada (British Columbia, 5.5%) and the highest rates
in Newfoundland (9.0%). Minges et al. [43] reported, based
on all three studies they included, diabetes prevalence in
indigenous Australian populations living in remote area was
approximately twice that in the urban populations. Finally,
after stratifying by country-level income, a meta-analysis of
19 studies [51] showed that the risk of T2D in urban versus
rural areas was not significantly different (OR 1.15, 95%
CI 0.70–1.89), however, highly walkable neighbourhoods
were associated with a decreased in risk (OR 0.79, 95% CI
0.71–0.87).
Built Environment (n=5)
Limited evidence from four narrative reviews suggested that
an environment promoting walkability, access to greenspaces and safe and connected streets is associated with lower
levels of obesity and higher levels of physical activity, which
in turn impact rates of T2D [19, 23, 45, 52]. Neighbourhood
characteristics like density of healthy food outlets or fastfood outlets, crime, perceived safety, walkability and access
to parks/green space was found to impact insulin resistance
and diabetes through their influence on physical activity and
diet [45]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies concluded that green
residential environment was associated with a decrease in
T2D prevalence (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.86–0.89) and mortality
(HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.93) [53].
Environmental Pollution (n=10)
Limited evidence shows that environmental pollutants in
food sources may be associated with an increased risk of diabetes. High intake of nitrites and n-nitroso compounds were
associated with T1D in children [37]. Kuo et al. [54] also
noted a causal association between T2D and the presence
of arsenic, mercury, cadmium, persistent organic pollutants (POP), phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA) in foods.
Consuming contaminated water and foods can result in the
bioaccumulation of environmental toxins in the food chain
like arsenic, mercury, diocin-like compounds, phalates, and
BPA [55]. These contaminants can interfere with pancreas
function and disrupt the endocrine system leading to obesity,
a known risk factor for diabetes. Indigenous people in Canada experience 3–5 times higher rates of diabetes compared
to the general population; this disparity may be partially
explained by the bioaccumulation of toxins in traditional
diet (wild game and fish) [55].
In general, there were limited details on measurement of
environmental pollutants, but many studies included satellite images of pollution level in combination with health
administrative data sources. Air-borne pollutants result from
many [56] mitigatable contextual sources, including but not
limited to forest fires, road traffic, manufacturing industries,
and in home settings. For example, Thibault et al.’s [27]
systematic review focusing on Canadian population found
that nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM), POP,
and non-persistent pesticides could partially explain recent
increase in T2D prevalence. Also, prolonged exposure to
NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 has been associated with increased
risk of T2D [27, 57, 58]. Stratified analysis indicated that
PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase in T2D
incidence in American countries, but not in European countries [58]. Di Ciaula and colleagues [57] found that T1D
incidence among youth aged 0–15 years was greater in European countries with greater emissions of PM10, NO, and
volatile organic compounds (VOCs).Wang et al. [56] found
that noise pollution may also increase the odds of developing
diabetes (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03–1.12).
Food Security/Environment (n=11)
Upstream contextual factors contributing to poor diet
includes food insecurity, and poor food environment characterised by limited access to healthy foods or access to an
abundance of unhealthy foods. In general, an inverse relationship between diet quality and rates of T2D was observed.
Poor diet was generally defined as energy dense and nutrient
poor.
After controlling for income, employment status, and
some physical/lifestyle factors, Gucciardi et al. [59] found
that the prevalence of T2D was 2–3 times higher among
adults who experience food insecurity in North America
compared to those that are food secure. The prevalence of
food insecurity was also higher among those with diabetes and the risk of food insecurity increased with length
of diabetes diagnosis. More specifically, four reviews suggested that income plays an important role such that those
experiencing food insecurity or living in food deserts are 
 19 Page 10 of 13 Current Diabetes Reports (2025) 25:19
at increased risk of T2D [19, 33, 37, 60]. On the contrary,
den Braver et al. [51], concluded that there is no statistically
significant relationship between availability of supermarkets/
grocery stores, or availability of fast-food outlets/convenience stores, and risk of T2D.
Adeghate et al. [37] reported that diets higher in fat, and
lower in fibre are associated with obesity and T2D. Weisman et al. [22] indicated that consumption of high glycemic
index foods and sugar-sweetened beverages are associated
with increased risk of T2D, and that high fiber foods has a
protective effect.
Discussion
This overview aimed to identify physical, socio-cultural,
environmental, political, and/or economic contextual factors related to the incidence or prevalence of T1D and T2D.
This review identified 48 reviews, including 26 systematic
reviews (with or without meta-analysis), and 22 narrative
reviews.
Ten contextual factors related to diabetes were identified:
income, employment, education, immigration, race/ethnicity, geography, built environment, environmental pollution,
rural/urban status, and food security/environment.
Due to heterogeneous nature of reviews regarding population characteristics, study location, measures used, and
outcomes reported, summary statistics could not be calculated. However, our results suggest that race/ethnicity and
income may be the most important factors related to diabetes
prevalence and that many of the identified contextual factors
interact with each other and may be confounded by overlapping variables. For example, rural or urban status may
be an important factor related to diabetes prevalence, but
this may also be because those living in rural regions may
belong to lower socioeconomic groups, and may be exposed
to poor built environment, therefore putting them at higher
risk for obesity and diabetes. These findings should be interpreted with caution since some primary studies may have not
been in the included reviews or were over-represented due
to overlap across reviews. Additionally, reviews identified
both individual-level and ecological studies. More evidence
amongst individuals with diabetes would be beneficial to
strengthen current measures of association related to diabetes and upstream contextual factors.
Our initial protocol only included the AMSTAR 2 quality assessment tool, specifically designed for systematic
reviews. Since almost half of the reviews were narrative,
we had to incorporate a second quality assessment tool
(SANRA). Most systematic reviews were of low or critically low quality, while most narrative reviews were ranked
as moderate to low quality. Given that the World Health
Organization identified diabetes as “one of the major public
health challenges in the 21st century” [65] and considering
the OECD’s highlights the influence of demographic, economic, and social contexts on health status and outcomes
[2], it is surprising that there is lack of high-quality evidence
from OECD countries. This further emphasizes the need for
more studies of good quality providing qualitative evidence
on contextual factors related to diabetes risk.
Despite the low quality and lack of qualitative evidence in
the current literature, this work provides insights into some
broader factors that may influence rates of diabetes that warrant further investigation and that could be incorporated into
future diabetes surveillance reporting among OECD countries. Several reports [66–68], have called upon improvements of public health surveillance through the monitoring
of social determinants of health to support health promotion, intervention programs, and chronic disease prevention.
Therefore, health surveillance systems should go beyond
traditional disease indicators, and incorporate contextdependent metrics to apply health equity principles. This
broadens the system’s capacity to monitor intervention and
policy effectiveness, offering potential insights into observed
trends or patterns [69].
Conclusion
In addition to shaping the values and relationships attributed to health, socioeconomic, cultural, political, and physical contexts also contribute to the availability, distribution
and quality of public infrastructure and resources. These
in turn impact key social determinants of health such as
housing, education, social services, and healthcare that
contribute to the burden of diabetes and other chronic diseases in OECD countries [10].This review identified ten
provisional upstream contextual variables that should be
further explored, including income, employment, education,
immigration, race/ethnicity, geography, built environment,
environmental pollution, rural/urban status, and food security. Thus, qualitative evidence on these factors at the individual level, including comparators without diabetes, can
inform urban planning for a healthier living environment.
Future research should delve into non-traditional diabetes
risk factors like built environment, environmental pollution,
and food security/environment to enhance surveillance and
inform public health policies.
