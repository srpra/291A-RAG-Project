Introduction
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is defined as a metabolic disease involving defective insulin action.1 The resulting hyperglycemia places individuals at high risk for all-cause mortality by
health expenditure of around 966 billion USD.2 An estimated
50% of diabetes cases globally remain undetected or undiagnosed3 and over half of diabetes’ economic cost lies in its treatment.2 Diabetes prevention programs (DPPs) are increasingly

ABSTRACT
Objectives: Diabetes in the 21st century presents one of the greatest burdens of disease on the global population. Digitally mediated
interventions have become imperative in alleviating this disease epidemic. We aimed to systematically review randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) on different health technologies for preventing Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their efficacy in decreasing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk patients in comparison to standard care.
Methods: Five electronic databases were searched between October 2021 and December 2022. Studies including digital health technology interventions used for preventing diabetes development by reducing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk adults (⩾18 years) were
identified. Data on glycemic levels, incidence of T2DM, weight, and intervention descriptions were extracted, and the risk of bias (ROB) was
assessed.
Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and 5 studies (56%) achieved clinically significant outcomes in at least one of the following: decreased weight (22%), glycemic levels (22%), or incidence of T2DM (11%). Two of the 3 (67%) computer-based interventions effectively reduced the HbA1c levels and mean weight of their study population, and 3 of 6 (50%) mobile based interventions (text messages,
mobile app, and telehealth) decreased the incidence of T2DM and HbA1c levels. Four studies each had an overall low ROB and one had a
high ROB due to attrition.
Conclusion: Preliminary evidence identified in our review demonstrated that health technologies for diabetes prevention are effective for
improving diabetes risk-related outcomes. Future research into digital technology protocol and studies of longer duration and more diverse
populations are needed for clinical feasibility.
Plain Language Summary
Role of Digital technology in Diabetes prevention
In the 21st century, diabetes has become a major health challenge globally. To address this, we conducted a systematic review, looking at
studies that used digital interventions to prevent Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and how effective they are compared to standard care. In
this study, we searched electronic databases from October 2021 to December 2022 and identified 9 studies that met our criteria. These
studies focused on adults aged 18 and above who were at risk of developing diabetes. We looked at outcomes like glucose concentrations,
T2DM incidence, and weight, and assessed the risk of bias in each study. The results showed that more than half of the studies showed significant outcomes. For instance, some interventions led to decreased weight, lower glucose concentrations, or reduced incidence of T2DM.
Computer-based interventions and mobile-based interventions (including text messages, mobile apps, and telehealth) were particularly
effective in improving these outcomes. In conclusion, our review suggests that digital health technologies can be effective in preventing diabetes and improving related outcomes. However, we note that more research is needed, especially looking at diverse populations and longer
study durations, to confirm the clinical feasibility of these digital interventions for diabetes prevention. This is a promising step forward in
using technology to tackle the growing diabetes epidemic, offering new ways to support individuals at risk and improve their health
outcomes.

crucial in mediating this exponential disease epidemic. With
healthcare systems’ gradual digitalization, the mediation of DPPs
through technological platforms can aid in translating and disseminating these preventative interventions into clinical and
public health settings.
Diabetes prevention is traditionally grounded in behavioral change theory, where lifestyle modifications are normalized through educational curriculum, health coaching and
peer support in individual and group settings.4 Landmark
clinical trials prove that intensive lifestyle interventions targeting physical activity and healthy diets are effective in
reducing the progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 58%
in comparison to pharmacological interventions.5-8 They
yield long-term results at follow-up with a T2DM reduction
of up to 43% that persists for decades for particular populations,5,6 but with the growing global incidence of diabetes,
this evidence requires translation into a multifaceted systems
approach.9 In a public health setting, literature indicates the
need to develop local health economies that facilitate communication and accessibility between the different levels of
health care.9 At the patient level, barriers to accessibility and
adherence need to be overcome.1,10 At the clinical practice
level, the increasing prevalence of diabetes-related complications9 requires a shift of patient management from episodic
primary physician checks to a chronic care model.11 At an
administrative level, the economic burden on public health
systems can be ameliorated by socio-structural change via
health policies, health education12 and the development of
supportive community environments.13
Digital health technology refers to the use of digital and
information technologies, such as mobile devices, wearables,
health information systems, software applications, and telehealth services, to improve the delivery and management of
healthcare.14,15 It covers a wide range of tools and solutions
crafted to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of
healthcare services while empowering individuals to actively
engage in their health management. The origins of digital
health technology can be traced back to the integration of
computers into healthcare settings during the mid-20th century. Initially used for administrative tasks, these technologies
gradually expanded to encompass clinical and patient care.16
The rapid evolution of digital health technology was further
fueled by the advent of the internet and the widespread use of
personal computing devices. Over the past few decades, there
has been a notable surge in the development and acceptance of
digital health solutions. The widespread adoption of smartphones, wearable devices, and the availability of high-speed
internet have been pivotal factors contributing to this growth.17
Digital health technologies now encompass a diverse array of
applications, including electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, mobile health apps, remote patient monitoring,
health informatics, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
for healthcare analytics.18,19
Herman20 identified the key shared features accounting for
the success of major DDP trials. These include individualization of patient interventions, flexibility between group and
individual settings, a mixture of physical and behavioral activities and an “extensive network of training, feedback and clinical
support.”1 Evidence indicates that health technologies fulfill all
these criteria by extending diabetes prevention from clinical
settings to creating an individual’s daily health-protective environment.10 Health technologies act as intermediary platforms
that transfer information between patient and provider whilst
normalizing behavioral interventions and lifestyle modifications in the patients’ surroundings and communities.
Regarding computer-based interventions, there is little evidence of its impact on diabetes prevention as software focuses
on known diabetes and population management between various health providers, remote patient monitoring and diabetes
self-management.21 A Cochrane meta-analysis comparing 16
computer-mediated diabetes education programs demonstrated a small decrease in HbA1c in patients diagnosed with
T2DM and has potential in translation to preventative
interventions.22
There is also a paucity of data on the efficacy of digital
health technology in diabetes prevention. Past studies that
showed evidence of positive correlations between digitally
translated DPPs and improved diabetes risk-related outcomes
have been limited by their short duration (5-24months) and
the lack of long-term follow-up. These affect the predictive
validity of results by not accounting for fluctuating weight and
glycemic levels. The heterogeneity of study location and participant demographic and high variability in program procedure affects the feasibility of public health implementation and
scalability as study outcomes may not be generalizable to other
national or global contexts. Due to these research gaps, this
paper aims to systematically review and compare current evidence about digitalized DPPs’ efficacy in reducing the incidence of diabetes and identify any shared features that may
assist in optimizing current interventions and improving health
outcomes for at-risk individuals.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted using guidelines from
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions23 and the protocol was registered with the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
PROSPERO (#: CRD42022344100).
Search strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted using 5 electronic
databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Ovid Medline, EMBASE and
Cochrane Library) in October 2022 with a search strategy
structured using the PICO tool24 consisting of related keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) as seen below:
Nguyen et al 3
• Population: T2DM, prediabet*
• Intervention: Technology health, digital technology, biomedical technology
• Comparison: standard treatment, control
• Outcomes: decrease* risk, weight loss, decreas* BMI,
decreas* blood glucose, decreas* hyperglycemia, improv*
glycemic control, decreas* waist circumference
Boolean search terms “OR” and “AND” enforced a distinction
between specified and generalized terms. Filters limiting peerreviewed journal articles to randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) and study recency to the last 10 years were applied. The
final search strategy was as follows: (((MM T2DM OR
prediabet*[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (standard treatment
OR control)) AND (MM Technology, health OR digital technology OR biomedical technology)) AND (decreas* risk OR
weight loss OR decreas* BMI OR decreas* blood glucose OR
decreas* hyperglycemia OR improv* glycemic control OR
decreas* waist circumference). The same search strategy was
replicated across the various databases.
Eligibility criteria
Titles and abstracts of studies were screened by 2 independent
reviewers (VN, PA) for eligibility. Results were compared to
finalize selection and any disagreements were resolved through
discussion. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they: (i)
assessed adult (>18years) populations who were at risk of
developing diabetes; (ii) involved technology-based interventions which could be fully digitally-mediated or delivered in a
mixed digital and face-to-face format; (iii) involved interventions explicitly aimed at reducing the risk of diabetes development; (iv) had outcome features related to body weight,
glycemic levels or T2DM incidence (decreased BMI, decreased
waist circumference, weight loss percentage, decreased fasting
blood glucose or HbA1c); (v) in the RCT study format; and
(vi) are available in English with full text.
Exclusion criteria included: (i) studies involving populations with diabetes diagnoses; (ii) interventions with no digital technology component; and (iii) interventions aimed at
managing existing diabetes rather than preventing diabetes
incidence.
Data extraction
Due to the small scale of the systematic review (2 reviewers
and less than 20 studies), data was stored using standard data
extraction templates on Google Forms based on Cochrane
guidelines.23 Data was extracted from all studies by 1 reviewer
(VN) then a second reviewer (PG) independently repeated
extraction on a random 20% of selected studies to confirm
accuracy. Disagreements were resolved with discussion. Data
about primary outcomes related to reducing diabetes risk
were sought for extraction to compare intervention efficacy.
Studies were grouped by these primary outcomes (decreased
BMI, weight, glycemic levels, and T2DM incidence) and the
mean and standard deviation of baseline and end-of-study
results were tabulated with P-values and confidence intervals, where available, to compare statistical significance.
Study variables extracted include the following intervention
characteristics: author, year of publication, population sample size, study design, country of study, the study’s definition
of “at-risk” and intervention characteristics, primary outcome
unit of measurement and study duration. Narrative synthesis
was chosen to summarize these intervention characteristics
and outcomes due to clinical heterogeneity (population baseline characteristics and intervention methods) and methodological heterogeneity.
Assessing bias
The quality of selected studies was assessed for risk of bias
(RoB) using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool25 by 1 reviewer
(VN). A random 20% of studies were screened by a second
reviewer (PG) to confirm reliability. Disagreements were
resolved with discussion. Studies were rated either “low risk,”
“some concerns” or “high risk” over 5 different domains. They
were deemed “low risk” if they scored “low risk” on all domains
or if the domains of “some concern” were highly unlikely to
affect study results and deemed “high risk” if they scored “high
risk” in at least 1 domain. Results were presented in Robvis26
traffic light and weighted bar plots.
Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE scale27
where reviewers’ confidence in the similarity of the true effect
and the estimated effect were graded by 4 levels of certainty—
“high,” “moderate,” “low,” and “very low.”
Results
Reporting of the study findings followed the Prisma protocol
as shown in the checklist (see Supplemental Table 1). The
PRISMA flow diagram28 shown in Figure 1 details the process
of study selection and reasons for exclusion. The initial literature search identified 226 articles and after duplicates were
removed 151 publications were screened by title and abstract.
Forty studies were sought for retrieval and 1 study was not
available on public databases. Thirty-nine studies from the following databases, PubMed (8), Ebsco (3) Ovid Medline (14),
Cochrane (6), and other sources (8) underwent double screening and were assessed for eligibility after which 9 studies were
included in this systematic review.
The basic characteristics of the reviewed studies are summarized in Table 1. Four of the studies that were included in
the full-text review were from PubMed, 3 from Cochrane, and
2 from Medline libraries. Many of the studies (n=44.4%) were
conducted in America29-33 with a single study site each in New
Zealand,34 India,35 Hong Kong,36 Bangladesh,37 and 1 jointly
conducted in the UK and India.31 Eight out of 9 studies were
parallel 2-arm RCTs29-37 while 1 study was a 3-arm cluster 
4 Clinical Medicine Insights: Endocrinology and Diabetes
RCT.37 Six studies recruited participants from primary healthcare settings29-34, 3 studies recruited from the workplace,32,35,36
and 1 from the community.37
Eight (89%) out of 9 studies’ populations were of mixed
gender29-34,36,37 with 1 study population being exclusively
male.35 The 4 American studies defined an individual at risk of
diabetes or in the prediabetes stage with HbA1c scores of 5.7%
to 6.4% or 39 to 46mmol/mol.29-31,33 Other studies recruited
participants in the upper prediabetes range (HbA1c>5.9%)32
or defined at-risk populations by BMIs greater than 23 kg/m2,
positive family histories of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
oral glucose tolerance test scores (14-200mg/dL) or fasting
plasma glucose scores (100-125mg/dL).35
Intervention methods varied across studies where differing combinations of health coaching, educational resources,
peer support groups and goal tracking were mediated through
various digital platforms.29-37 A single intervention31 used
individually tailored websites and interactive emails while 7
interventions29,30,32,33,35-37 used mobile devices via text or
voice messages,29,32,33,35-37 telephone-mediated coaching29 or
mobile applications.30,34 Digital technology was supplementary to in-person or online coaching by a health coach in 5
studies29,30,33,34,37, four studies were automated and
algorithm-driven.31,32,35,36

12-month interventions with Block et al31 demonstrating significant reductions in HbA1c (−2.8mmol/mol [95% CI −0.27,
−0.24], P= .002) from a DPP mediated through individually
tailored websites and interactive emails. Katula et al’s33 study
demonstrated a shift in HbA1c levels from the prediabetes to
the normal range (−0.23% [95% CI −0.26, −0.20]) due to an
internet-accessible device (mobile, computer, smartwatch)
mediated DPP, while McLeod et al’s34 mobile and web-based
individual and peer support coaching intervention showed no
difference between study arms.
The primary outcome of the 2 studies29,30 was a percentage
change in weight or BMI. Fukuoka et al’s30 mixed intervention
with in-person DPP sessions, supplementary interactive mobile
app and pedometer use proved effective in weight loss (6.8%
[95% CI,4.6,9.1]) while Fischer et al29 proved the efficacy of
text-message enhancement of DPPs in Spanish populations
with a comparable portion of the study population losing 3%
baseline weight (47.1% [95% CI 33.4-60.8]) compared to
English speakers (20.6% [95% CI 7/0-34.2]).
Four studies32,35-37 examined an outcome of diabetes incidence in relation to DPP interventions mediated over mobile
phone messaging with 3 studies32,35,36 yielding clinically significant results. Ramachandran et al38 and Wong et al’s36 studies examining behavioral change theory-oriented text messages
both affected the lower cumulative incidence of T2DM in

Risk of bias
Using Cochrane Collaboration Tool’s RoB 2,25 Figure 2 details
the result of assessment by domains for the selected studies. Four
studies were identified with an overall low ROB,29,33,35,37 another
with a high ROB due to attrition (incomplete follow-up and
patient retention)36 and for 4 other studies, there were some concerns of attrition bias (patient non-compliance or retention) to a
lesser degree.30-32,34 There was no selection bias in the reviewed
studies due to the adequate randomization and allocation concealment in the studies. Regarding performance bias, by nature
of the interventions, the majority of patients and caregivers could
not be blinded but this did not affect study outcomes. Detection
bias was present in 2 studies whose outcomes were not statistically significant29,36 and no reporting bias was identified as all
measured outcomes were reported in the final analysis.
Discussion
This review study identified 5 studies30,31,35-37 that showed
clinically significant reductions of various diabetes risk related
outcomes especially glycemic levels, weight, BMI and reduced
incidence of T2DM, possibly strengthening available literature
on the efficacy of 2 main digital modalities (computer and
mobile devices) in diabetes prevention. Despite the statistical
significance of these RCTs, the studies were significantly heterogeneous in their outcomes due to the large variation in the
intervention methods. The study findings suggest that the efficacy of individual DPPs may be due to the synergistic effect of
various modes of delivery (technological and in-person) rather
than the superiority of one modality over the others. However,
due to the small number of studies about each digital modality,
the impact of these variations in the intervention could not be
properly assessed.
In this study, there were 2 RCTs31,33 involving computerbased DPPs that yielded statistically significant results, proving
the capacity of computers to fully automate DPPs or to act in a
supplementary role – providing resources alongside in-person
curriculums. For one study,31 after 6months, the use of individualized websites and interactive emails improved the

glycemic level, body weight and 8-year diabetes risk of people
with prediabetes. The use of computer-mediated peer support
groups, tracking and behavioral change curriculums yielded significant weight loss at 12months,33 whereas mobile-mediated
interventions led to positive outcomes such as greater weight
loss over time and reduction in the risk of developing diabetes
at 12months.30,35,36 A text-messaging intervention where delivered content was individualised39 and one where messages were
standardized to collective participant preferences,36 both
decreased the cumulative incidence of T2DM. In agreement
with previous evidence,39,40 supporting in-person DPP sessions
with a mobile app for tracking progress and mediating educational resources achieved clinically significant weight loss,30
thus affirming the strength of mobile-mediated interventions in
increasing patient adherence through positive reinforcement.39,40 This has also been linked to high retention rates in
clinical trials.29,30,32,33,35-37
On the other hand, mobile-mediated DPPs are effective in
consistently reinforcing patient education,39,41 self-monitoring and social support39 which prevents non-adherence. The
high global levels of smartphone ownership40 further decrease
economic expenditure and accommodate a widespread dissemination of intervention programs. Four text message-based
programs focused on stage-based behavioral change were
shown to significantly reduce the progression of prediabetes to
diabetes with preventative outcomes of weight loss and diet
logging.29,35,38,42 In examining a broad digitalization of DPPs,
a 2017 meta-analysis correlates smartphone apps mediating
health professional personal contact with increased weight
loss, in comparison to complete automated contact.43
Evidently, by replacing in-person group exercise sessions with
phone-app delivered home regimens, Fukuoka et al’s30 intervention yielded no change in glucose levels, supporting how
retaining partial human factors in delivery is still imperative in
patient adherence and response.
Regarding the effect of computer-based therapies in
decreasing HbA1c in at-risk patients, the evidence is judged to
be moderate in quality. The studies have a generally low risk of
bias besides some concerns of attrition for participant retention.31,33 There is no great imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias but the heterogeneity of the intervention method and
the data of statistical significance only being sourced from 3
studies, lowers confidence in the review’s results. For mobilebased therapies and their impact on reducing the incidence of
T2DM, the evidence is judged to be of low quality. There is
moderate to high risk in 2 out of 3 studies of statistical significance and the sample size in those studies was small (61 and
104 participants).30,36 The RCTs have no obvious imprecision,
indirectness, or publication bias but the heterogeneity of intervention and study protocol were variable.
Digital health technology interventions play a pivotal role in
augmenting existing strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These interventions leverage innovative
technological solutions to enhance outreach, education, monitoring, and management of individuals at risk for T2DM. By
incorporating mobile applications, wearable devices, and online
platforms, digital health technologies provide personalized and
real-time interventions, promoting lifestyle modifications and
behavior change. These tools facilitate continuous glucose monitoring, physical activity tracking, and dietary management,
empowering individuals to take an active role in their health.
Moreover, digital interventions enable healthcare providers to
remotely monitor patients, offer timely if not real-time feedback,
and tailor interventions based on individual progress. The integration of data analytics and machine learning further refines
predictive models, identifying high-risk populations and customizing intervention strategies. In essence, digital health technology interventions not only complement but also transform
conventional approaches to T2DM prevention, fostering a more
dynamic, individualized, and proactive healthcare paradigm.
Implications for practice
This study provided evidence for the generalized efficacy of
health technologies in preventing diabetes by reducing riskrelated outcomes as 5 studies within this review demonstrated
statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and diabetes incidence. Further research is needed to translate this data into
clinical settings. The feasibility of digitally mediated DPPs is
supported by the gradual modernization of the healthcare system and public accessibility to technology but this can be better
understood with more pragmatic trials involving diverse populations or interventions that are culturally adapted (which
showed a positive outcome in one study.29 We also provided
evidence of appropriateness, as diabetes prevention involves
self-management and literature which identifies mobiledevices efficacy in increasing patient engagement39,40 and the
high retention rates of studies within this review29,30,32,33,35-37
support this. Evidence of meaningfulness was unavailable as
patient-rated outcomes were not examined in this review and
effectiveness is difficult to determine with the moderate to low
quality evidence of the chosen studies.
Establishing a sustainable infrastructure for digital diabetes
prevention programs is imperative for its long-term success.
This infrastructure should prioritize interoperability with
existing health information systems, ensuring seamless data
exchange and continuity of care. Robust cybersecurity measures, including secure data storage and transmission, are essential to protect patient information and comply with healthcare
data protection regulations. The use of scalable, cloud-based
architecture enables flexibility and accommodates a growing
user base, while user-friendly interfaces cater to a diverse range
of users. Integration with wearable and IoT devices allows for
real-time data collection, and analytics tools provide insights
for continuous program improvement. Training modules and
support mechanisms ensure both healthcare providers and 
10 Clinical Medicine Insights: Endocrinology and Diabetes
end-users can effectively utilize the program. Regulatory compliance frameworks, reliable telecommunication infrastructure,
and continuous monitoring and maintenance further contribute to the infrastructure’s resilience. By addressing these components comprehensively, digital diabetes prevention programs
can seamlessly integrate into healthcare systems, promoting
sustained engagement and positive health outcomes.
Limitations and future research
The following limitations should be considered when interpreting this data. First, there was a small number of studies that met
the eligibility criteria in this systematic review and the heterogeneity of study design (population, intervention mode of delivery, method, duration) collectively led to difficulty in comparison
and inability to perform a meta-analysis to assess the strength of
data. Although we have restricted the studies to increase the
robustness of our study, future studies might include other nonRCTs for a better understanding of the impact of DPPs. Second,
the study populations in the included studies lacked diversity
which could affect the scalability and accessibility of these
interventions. The fact that some studies were single-gendered,
others recruited from specific workplaces or ethnic groups without cultural adaptation of the DPP program, may have affected
the participant engagement. Third, the study durations were
short ranging from 5 to 36months with the longest follow-up at
24months and both these factors limit the external validity of
DPP interventions which target a chronic and global health
issue. Also, the reviewed studies were all written in English
including the Hong Kong Study. This could potentially exclude
crucial findings from studies not written in English. Articles
not written in English from non-English speaking jurisdictions
should also be reviewed in future studies.
In this study, we identified a research gap with studies that
examined specific aspects of health technologies for increased
patient engagement. Two studies imply the importance of partial
human factors in interventions, attributing high retention rates
to healthcare staff delivering the intervention27 and the participatory in-person activities.37 Therefore, studying the interactive
nature of digital and in-person modalities may optimize intervention protocol. Understanding the difference between personalized or standardized interventions and full automation or
partial digital mediation is important and can be further explored
in future studies.
An examination of diverse digital health approaches across
different populations, healthcare systems, and cultural contexts
is needed to develop targeted and culturally sensitive digital
intervention solutions. Also, research should focus on identifying determinants of successful implementation, such as user
engagement, usability, and adherence, to optimize intervention
designs for maximum impact. Thirdly, continuous evaluation
of digital interventions over the long term is crucial to assess
their effectiveness and sustainability, informing potential
updates or modifications. Fourthly, exploring the integration of
digital health technologies into existing healthcare systems,
considering interoperability, data security, and impact on workflows, is essential for successful implementation on a broader
scale. Lastly, investigating the cost-effectiveness and scalability
of these interventions will be vital for their widespread adoption and integration into routine healthcare practices.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this review supports the current literature’s
generalized perspective on the efficacy of health technology
in diabetes prevention and presents some evidence of positive correlations between digitally translated DPPs and
improved diabetes risk-related outcomes. Yet, the heterogeneity in intervention protocol and study procedure and the
lack of diverse populations or long-term data and follow-up
undermine the possibilities of clinical effectiveness and the
feasibility of public health implementation and scalability
due to the risk of economic burden and the chance of patient
non-adherence. Future research should include studies of
larger diverse populations with longer duration and followup data and specific aspects of health technologies that
increase patient engagement and the possibility of clinically
significant outcomes.
